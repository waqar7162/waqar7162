## About Me
Hi, my name is Waqar and I am currently completing a bootcamp program in Data Science. I have previously studied Software Engineering for some time and worked with programming languages such as C and C++ which helped me develop an interest in Data Science.

## Education and Qualifications
Sep 2019- July 2021, Virtual University of Pakistan, Bs Software Engineering (incomplete)

Relevant modules:
-Intro to computing and programming 
-Calculus and analytical geometry 
-Object oriented programming

## Skills and Projects 
I am proficient in working with C and C++ programming languages. 
During the course I was required to develop a program that can support the working of a clinic dealing with large number of patients incoming for Covid-19 testing. I was able to successfully develop the program using C++ language to include the functional features of identification, aggregation and categorization of patients on the basis of gender, age, test report and identification of high risk patients.

As a current Data Science student I am working with programming languages such as Python and also with Command Prompt, Git and Github. I have successfully completed the assigned tasks using these languages and looking forward learning more.
